        <h4>Specialist</h4>
        <p>"As a child, I was always extra curious about things. I always wanted to be outside in nature or diving into various books to learn and understand more that was around me. 
            As I grew into an adult, I had sneak peeks of the path of the witches but I never opened the door myself until I was well into my twenties. 
            From there, I swung the door wide open and dove straight into the ocean. 
            Absorbing any and all information I could about the path, which has led me to this point. 
            As a teacher, I am also the student, so my hopes with this business is to share and learn as we all grow together.
            Added with the physical attributes of cleanliness, and spiritual cleansing.. not only do we do the physical cleaning, but we also offer the energetic and spiritual 
            cleansing that allows us to remove any imbalances that may have been shifted to an material item from the human/animal embodiment. 
            So, as your space gets a good cleansing, your soul gets a breath of fresh air."

        <h4>Healer</h4>
        <p>"My name is Kathy Czikalla. I have always been very spiritual and loved learning. I loved crystals and stones all of my life. I had heard of the healing capabilities that
            they held but was always more drawn to their beauty. I lost a daughter and a son in 2012 and a good friend gave me a Rose Quartz worry Stone. I felt the warmth and love come 
            from it as soon as I held it. While at a metaphysical show a woman grabbed my hand and told
            she could feel my broken heart. She put a small tumble of black onyx in my hand and told me this will help with my grief and that I needed to share my gifts. This was the beginning 
            of when my healing capabilities with crystals came to light. I now make healing bracelets and Affirmation Mirrors which helped in the healing process of many. I look forward to be able to help others."
