        LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the
        Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds
        of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black
        highlighters.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably
        the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that
        renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting
        policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
      </p>
      <p>
        CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably
        never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the Cold War</li>
        <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
      </ul>
